The `FAIL` function stops the execution of the WarpScript scripts by throwing an exception.



## Example ##

WarpScript commands:
    
    FAIL

Stack:

    
    TOP: 

{% raw %}
<warp10-warpscript-widget backend="{{backend}}"  exec-endpoint="{{execEndpoint}}">FAIL
</warp10-warpscript-widget>
{% endraw %}
