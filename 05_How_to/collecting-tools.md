### Collecting metrics using 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools

There are many collecting tools out there. For some of the most popular ones, a specific backend or plugin have been developed to make them push data directly onto a Warp 10 instance. The only requirement is to know the entry point of your Warp 10 platform and the specific token of the application.

* [**StatsD**](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) is a small network daemon that runs on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) platform listens for statistics, like counters and timers and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services. Our backend for StatsD is available [here on github](https://github.com/cityzendata/statsd-warp10-backend.git).

* [**CollectD**](https://collectd.org/) is a daemon which collects system performance statistics periodically. Our plugin for CollectD is available [here on github](https://github.com/cityzendata/collectd-plugin-warp10.git).

* [**FluentD**](http://www.fluentd.org/) is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data. Our plugin for FluentD is available [here on github](https://github.com/cityzendata/fluentd-plugin-warp10.git).

* [**Logstash**](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) is a data pipeline that helps you process logs and other event data from a variety of systems. Our output plugin for Logstash is available [here on github](https://github.com/cityzendata/logstash-output-warp10.git).

* [**Telegraf**](https://influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) is an open source agent written in Go for collecting metrics and data on the system it's running on or from other services. Our output plugin for Telegraf is available [here on github](https://github.com/cityzendata/telegraf-output-warp10.git).
