## Warp 10 data manipulation environment ##

* Dedicated language
* 5 frameworks
* 800+ functions
* Turing complete
* Fully extensible
* Sandboxed

We created *WarpScript*, an extensible stack oriented programming language which offers more than 800 functions and 
several high level frameworks to ease and speed your data analysis. Simply create scripts containing your data analysis 
code and submit them to the platform, they will execute close to where the data resides and you will get the result of 
that analysis as a JSON object that you can integrate into your application.

The WarpScript approach is another differentiating factor of Warp 10. Traditional time series platforms offer few 
manipulation options, usually only providing a SQL like query language which cannot express complex analysis, or 
providing a reduced set of aggregation functions. These approaches force you to produce more code on the client side 
thus increasing your development time and leading to massive transfers of unprocessed data from the platform to your 
applications. Our approach lets you focus on your business use cases, simplifying IoT and sensor data applications by 
taking care of a larger chunk of the data analysis in a very efficient way.
