## Warp10

The Warp 10 Platform is designed to collect, store and manipulate sensor data. Sensor data are ingested as sequences of 
measurements (also called time series). The Warp 10 Platform offers the possibility for each measurement to also have 
spatial metadata specifying the geographic coordinates and/or the elevation of the sensor at the time of the reading. 
Those augmented measurements form what we call Geo Time SeriesÂ® (GTS).
