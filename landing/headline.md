## Warp<span><sup>10</sup></span>

The Warp 10 core platform is build to manage and simplify time series processing. It includes a data collector tool, a store and a time series analytics language.
Warp 10 is adapted to store and analyse sequences of measurement such as the one provided by sensors, application metrics or any business event.
Each measurement is related to a specific time, a value and might have spatial metadata such as geographic coordinates and/or an elevation.
Those augmented measurements are what we call Geo Time SeriesÂ® (GTS).
