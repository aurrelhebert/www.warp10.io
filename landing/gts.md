## Geo Time Series<sup>®</sup>

The first differentiating factor of Warp 10 is that both space (location) and time are considered first class citizens. 
Working with Geo Time Series<sup>®</sup> (GTS) allows you to have geo-located readings without having to use four 
separate series and having to keep track of the reading context.

Complex searches like "find all the sensors active during last Monday in the perimeter delimited by this geo-fencing 
polygon" can be done without involving expensive joins between separate time series for the same source.
