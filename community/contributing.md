## Getting started

Creating an issue is the simplest form of contributing to Warp10. But there are many ways to contribute, including the 
following:

- Feature requests
- Bug reports
- Submitting Warp10 elements to the [catalogue](https://github.com/cityzendata/)
- Submitting pull requests

### Showing support for Warp10

Open source software is built by people like you, who spend their free time creating things the rest the community can use.

Don't have time to contribute? No worries, here are some other ways to show your support for Warp10:

- Star the project
- Tweet your support for Warp10
- Share the project [website](https://www.warp10.io/)
- Participate in the [Warp10 community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/warp10-users)

### Warp10's ecosystem

Warp10 is a large open source project made up of dozens of repositories. The core library provides low-level tools for 
both developers and Warp10 elements to save content, manage state, coordinate changes, authenticate users, and react 
to content updates.

The majority of Warp10's user-facing functionality comes from its [elements](https://github.com/cityzendata/). All 
Warp10's elements are open-source and uphold the same contributing and code of conduct guidelines as this library. 
Their repositories can be found in the [Warp10Elements](https://github.com/cityzendata/) organisation.

## Issues

### Before creating an issue

Please try to determine if the issue is caused by a) one of arp10's elements, or b) an underlying library, and if so 
create an issue there. Sometimes this is difficult to know, we only ask that you attempt to give a reasonable attempt to 
find out.

Try to follow these guidelines

- Avoid creating issues for implementation help. It's much better to keep the issue tracker focused on bugs and feature 
requests, ask implementation questions on [Warp10 community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/warp10-users)
- Investigate the issue
- Create the issue in the appropriate repository

### Creating an issue

Please be as descriptive as possible when creating an issue. Give us the information we need to successfully answer your
question or address your issue by answering the following in your issue:

- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Your environment (Warp10 version, other frameworks used)

### Closing issues

The original poster or the maintainers of Warp10 may close an issue at any time. Typically, but not exclusively, issues 
are closed when:

- The issue is resolved
- The project's maintainers have determined the issue is out of scope
- An issue is clearly a duplicate of another issue, in which case the duplicate issue will be linked.
- A discussion has clearly run its course

## Pull requests

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that the change it makes addresses an existing issue or feature request, or has
been discussed with the maintainers.

- Fill in [the required template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Ensure all tests are passing, and write new tests for added functionality

## New elements

One of the best ways to contribute to the Warp10 project is by creating your own Warp10 elements! We're planning much 
more thorough documentation for this soon, but to publish your element to the [catalogue](https://github.com/cityzendata/) 
submit a PR against [its repo](https://github.com/cityzendata/).
