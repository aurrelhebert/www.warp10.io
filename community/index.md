<h3>User Group</h3>

The community around the Warp 10 platform gathers around the Google Group 
[Warp 10 Users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/warp10-users) discussion group. It also meets in real life at 
occasional meetups. We don't reply on StackOverflow, so the Google Group  is the most appropriate place to post questions.

If you need commercial support for the solution, you can get access to members of the team behind the platform through 
one of the support plans offered by [Cityzen Data](http://www.cityzendata.com/).
